# contigent_value_right_model

The Board of Directors of both Gen and MoneyLion have unanimously approved the proposed acquisition of MoneyLion by Gen for $82.00 per share in cash payable at closing, representing a cash value of approximately $1 billion. 

In addition, for each share owned, MoneyLion shareholders will receive at closing one contingent value right ("CVR") that entitles the holder to a contingent payment of $23.00 in the form of shares of Gen common stock (issuable based on an assumed share price of $30.48 per Gen share) if Gen's average volume-weighted average share price reaches at least $37.50 per share over 30 consecutive trading days from December 10, 2024 until 24 months after close. 

There can be no assurance that any payments will be made with respect to CVRs. It is expected that the CVRs will be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

Make a model to price this CVR for any given GEN price and any given date.
